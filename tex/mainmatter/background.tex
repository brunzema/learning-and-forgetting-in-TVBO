\gls{tvbo} relies on fundamental knowledge about \glspl{gp} and \gls{bo} of which the relevant aspects are discussed in this chapter. Furthermore, to embed and formalize prior knowledge about the cost function staying convex through time, as stated in Assumption \ref{ass:prior_knowledge_convex}, shape constraints on \glspl{gp} will be used. This chapter will introduce a concept of enforcing shape constraints at finite points resulting in a high probability of the \gls{gp} being convex within the feasible set $\mathcal{X}$.
