# Learning and Forgetting in Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization

The repo containts the LaTeX source code of my master thesis which I conducted at the [Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~ibtrg/DSME/?lidx=1) at the RWTH Aachen University.

The main results were presented and published at the 61st IEEE Conference in Decision and Control in Cancun, Mexiko.
Feel free to check out the corresponding [repo of the paper](https://github.com/brunzema/uitvbo) and [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11120.pdf):
